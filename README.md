# EasyMiner-Tests
This branch contains test results and additional info from Travis CI integrations of tests from other branches in this repository.

This repository is published as website [here](https://kizi.github.io/EasyMiner-Tests/). This repository can contain up to 50 reports from lastest 50 Travis CI integrations.

Travis CI automatically pushes test reports directly to this branch after each build. Travis also updated main page. Automatic updates can be distinguished from pushes from regular user, because they use *Travis CI* as user name and *travis* as email. Also commit message always starts with *Travis build result*.

If you would like to change web site layout, change *index-part1.html* and *index-part2.html*. Those are templates for main page.
